# ✅ Navigation Error FIXED!

## 🐛 Error You Got
```
Filament\Navigation\NavigationManager::Filament\Navigation\{closure}(): 
Argument #1 ($group) must be of type Filament\Navigation\NavigationGroup|string, 
array given
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
Navigation groups were defined as **arrays with icons and sort orders**, but Filament v3 expects **simple strings** or NavigationGroup objects.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Before (Broken) ❌
```php
->navigationGroups([
    'Projects' => [
        'icon' => 'heroicon-o-briefcase',
        'sort' => 1,
    ],
    'Learning' => [
        'icon' => 'heroicon-o-academic-cap',
        'sort' => 2,
    ],
])
```

### After (Working) ✅
```php
->navigationGroups([
    'Projects',
    'Learning',
    'Tutoring',
    'Financial',
])
```
