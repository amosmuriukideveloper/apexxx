# Payment Integration Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. **Budget/Amount Not Showing ($0 displayed)**
**Problem:** The `budget` field wasn't in the Project model's `$fillable` array, and pricing wasn't being calculated or saved properly.

**Fixed:**
- Added `budget`, `difficulty_level`, `payment_status`, and `platform_commission` to Project model fillable fields
- Updated `calculatePricing()` method to properly set `budget = total_price`
- Added accessor `getBudgetAttribute()` to fallback to `total_price` if budget is null
- Both `budget` and `total_price` are now properly displayed on checkout pages

### 2. **M-Pesa Payment Not Processing**
**Problem:** Only had a phone number field, no actual STK Push integration.

**Fixed:**
- Created `app/Services/MpesaService.php` with full M-Pesa Daraja API integration
- Implements `initiateSTKPush()` for sending payment prompts to customer phones
- Implements `queryTransaction()` for checking payment status
- Updated ProjectPayment and TutoringPayment pages to use MpesaService
- Now properly initiates STK Push and prompts users to enter M-Pesa PIN on their phones

### 3. **PayPal Payment Not Processing**
**Problem:** Had placeholder TODO comments, no actual integration.

**Fixed:**
- Created `app/Services/PayPalService.php` with PayPal REST API v2 integration
- Implements `createOrder()` for creating checkout sessions
- Implements `captureOrder()` for capturing completed payments
- Redirects users to PayPal for seamless checkout experience
- Returns users back to the platform after payment

### 4. **Pesapal Payment Not Processing**
**Problem:** Had placeholder TODO comments, no actual integration.

**Fixed:**
- Created `app/Services/PesapalService.php` with Pesapal v3 API integration
- Implements `submitOrderRequest()` for creating payment orders
- Implements `getTransactionStatus()` for verifying payments
- Supports card payments and mobile money
- Redirects users to Pesapal secure payment gateway

### 5. **Tutoring Request Payments**
**Problem:** Same issues as projects - no actual payment processing.

**Fixed:**
- Updated TutoringRequest model to include pricing fields
- Implemented all three payment gateways (M-Pesa, PayPal, Pesapal)
- Now processes payments seamlessly like project payments

## Payment Flow Explained üîÑ

### **For Projects:**
1. Student creates a project
2. System calculates pricing based on:
   - Pages/words (Base Price: $10/page or $0.05/word)
   - Complexity level (Basic 1x, Intermediate 1.3x, Advanced 1.6x, Expert 2x)
   - Urgency (<24hrs 2x, <48hrs 1.5x, <72hrs 1.3x, >72hrs 1x)
3. Total = Base Price + Complexity Fee + Urgency Fee
4. Student redirected to payment page showing calculated amount
5. Student selects payment method (M-Pesa, PayPal, or Pesapal)
6. Payment processed through selected gateway
7. Project status updated to 'assigned' on successful payment

### **For Tutoring Requests:**
1. Student creates tutoring request
2. System calculates pricing based on duration and subject
3. Platform fee (15%) added to base price
4. Student sees total amount on payment page
5. Same payment flow as projects

## Important Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Sandbox vs Production:**
   - Always test in sandbox/demo mode first
   - Switch to production only when ready to accept real payments
   - Never mix sandbox and production credentials

2. **Security:**
   - Payment credentials are stored in the database (encrypted in production)
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data

3. **Callbacks/Webhooks:**
   - M-Pesa: Needs callback URL to be publicly accessible
   - PayPal: Set up webhooks for payment notifications
   - Pesapal: Configure IPN URL for payment status updates

4. **Currency:**
   - M-Pesa: KES (Kenyan Shillings)
   - Pesapal: Supports KES, USD, and others
   - PayPal: USD by default (configurable)

5. **Transaction Verification:**
   - Currently set to auto-verify after successful initiation
   - For production, implement proper callback verification
   - Check `payment_status` before allowing access to services

---

## Next Steps üöÄ

1. **Configure payment gateways** in admin panel
2. **Test each payment method** thoroughly
3. **Implement callback handlers** for production verification
4. **Set up proper error logging** for failed transactions
5. **Add email notifications** for payment confirmations
6. **Consider refund functionality** for cancelled orders
