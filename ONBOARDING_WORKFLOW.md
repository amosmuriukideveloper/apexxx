## 4. Approval Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

**When Admin Clicks "Approve":**

1. **Validation**
   ```php
   - Verify all required fields present
   - Check documents uploaded
   - Ensure no duplicate email exists
   ```

2. **Database Transaction Begins**
   ```php
   DB::beginTransaction();
   ```

3. **Account Creation** (based on applicant_type)

   **For Experts:**
   ```php
   Expert::create([
       'name' => $application->full_name,
       'email' => $application->email,
       'phone' => $application->phone,
       'specialization' => $application->field_of_study,
       'expertise_areas' => $application->expertise_areas,
       'years_of_experience' => $application->years_of_experience,
       'bio' => $application->why_join,
       'linkedin_profile' => $application->linkedin_profile,
       'sample_work_url' => $application->sample_work_url,
       'application_status' => 'approved',
       'status' => 'active',
       'documents_verified' => true,
       'rating' => 0,
       'total_projects_completed' => 0,
       'total_earnings' => 0,
   ]);
   ```

   **For Tutors:**
   ```php
   Tutor::create([
       // Similar fields plus:
       'available' => true,
       'hourly_rate' => 0,
       'total_sessions_completed' => 0,
   ]);
   ```

   **For Content Creators:**
   ```php
   ContentCreator::create([
       // Similar fields plus:
       'portfolio_url' => $application->sample_work_url,
       'total_courses_created' => 0,
   ]);
   ```

4. **Generate Secure Password**
   ```php
   $password = Str::random(12);
   // Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   ```

5. **Update Application Record**
   ```php
   $application->update([
       'status' => 'approved',
       'reviewed_by' => auth()->id(),
       'reviewed_at' => now(),
       'applicant_id' => $newAccount->id,
       'applicant_type' => get_class($newAccount),
   ]);
   ```

6. **Commit Transaction**
   ```php
   DB::commit();
   ```

7. **Send Welcome Email** (TODO)
   ```php
   Mail::to($application->email)->send(new WelcomeEmail([
       'name' => $application->full_name,
       'email' => $application->email,
       'password' => $password,
       'panel_url' => config('app.url') . '/expert', // or /tutor, /creator
       'login_instructions' => 'Use the credentials above...',
   ]));
   ```

8. **Log Activity**
   ```php
   SystemLog::create([
       'user_id' => auth()->id(),
       'action' => 'approved_application',
       'model_type' => ApplicationForm::class,
       'model_id' => $application->id,
       'description' => "Approved {$application->applicant_type} application for {$application->full_name}",
   ]);
   ```

9. **Show Success Notification**
   ```php
   Notification::make()
       ->success()
       ->title('Application Approved')
       ->body("Account created! Email: {$email}, Password: {$password}")
       ->persistent() // Stays until dismissed
       ->send();
   ```

### Error Handling

If any step fails:
```php
try {
    // ... approval process
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    DB::rollBack();
    
    Notification::make()
        ->danger()
        ->title('Approval Failed')
        ->body('Error: ' . $e->getMessage())
        ->send();
}
```

---

## 5. Rejection Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

**When Admin Clicks "Reject":**

1. **Rejection Form** (modal displayed)
   - **Rejection Reason** (required, textarea)
   - **Allow Reapplication** (toggle, default: true)

2. **Update Application**
   ```php
   $application->update([
       'status' => 'rejected',
       'reviewed_by' => auth()->id(),
       'reviewed_at' => now(),
       'review_notes' => $data['review_notes'],
   ]);
   ```

3. **Send Rejection Email** (TODO)
   ```php
   Mail::to($application->email)->send(new ApplicationRejectedEmail([
       'name' => $application->full_name,
       'reason' => $data['review_notes'],
       'improvements' => 'Please address the following...',
       'reapply_date' => now()->addDays(30),
       'support_email' => config('mail.support_email'),
   ]));
   ```

4. **Log Activity**
   ```php
   SystemLog::create([
       'action' => 'rejected_application',
       'description' => "Rejected {$application->applicant_type} application",
       'metadata' => ['reason' => $data['review_notes']],
   ]);
   ```

5. **Show Notification**
   ```php
   Notification::make()
       ->warning()
       ->title('Application Rejected')
       ->body('Rejection email will be sent to the applicant.')
       ->send();
   ```

---

## 6. Panel Access Control

### Middleware Implementation

**CheckAccountApproval Middleware** enforces access control:

```php
// Applied to panel routes
Route::middleware(['auth', 'check.approval'])->group(function () {
    // Expert panel routes
    // Tutor panel routes
    // Creator panel routes
});
```

### Access Logic

**For Pending Applications:**
```php
if ($expert->application_status === 'pending') {
    auth()->logout();
    return redirect()->route('login')
        ->with('warning', 'Your application is pending approval...');
}
```

**For Rejected Applications:**
```php
if ($expert->application_status === 'rejected') {
    auth()->logout();
    return redirect()->route('login')
        ->with('error', 'Your application has been rejected...');
}
```

**For Suspended/Inactive Accounts:**
```php
if (in_array($expert->status, ['suspended', 'inactive'])) {
    auth()->logout();
    return redirect()->route('login')
        ->with('error', 'Your account is currently ' . $expert->status);
}
```

### Session Management

- **Immediate Effect**: Status changes take effect on next page load
- **Security**: Unapproved users cannot bypass via direct URLs
- **User-Friendly**: Clear messages explain why access is denied
