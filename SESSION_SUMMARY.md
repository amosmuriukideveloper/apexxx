## ⚙️ Configuration Required

### 1. Register Middleware in `bootstrap/app.php` or `app/Http/Kernel.php`

```php
// Add to middleware groups
protected $middlewareGroups = [
    'web' => [
        // ... existing middleware
        \App\Http\Middleware\CheckUserStatus::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\LogActivity::class,
    ],
];

// Or register as route middleware
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    'check.status' => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckUserStatus::class,
    'check.approval' => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckAccountApproval::class,
    'log.activity' => \App\Http\Middleware\LogActivity::class,
];
```

### 2. Register Widgets (if not auto-discovered)

Widgets should be auto-discovered by Filament, but you can manually register them in a Panel Provider if needed.

### 3. Register Settings Pages (if not auto-discovered)

Settings pages should be auto-discovered by Filament in the `app/Filament/Pages` directory.
