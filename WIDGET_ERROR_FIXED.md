## 🔧 If You Want to Add More Widgets

### Example: Create Expert Stats Widget

```php
// app/Filament/Expert/Widgets/ExpertStatsOverview.php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Expert\Widgets;

use App\Models\Project;
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget as BaseWidget;
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class ExpertStatsOverview extends BaseWidget
{
    protected function getStats(): array
    {
        $assignedProjects = Project::where('assigned_expert_id', Auth::id())->count();
        $activeProjects = Project::where('assigned_expert_id', Auth::id())
            ->where('status', 'in_progress')->count();
        $completedProjects = Project::where('assigned_expert_id', Auth::id())
            ->where('status', 'completed')->count();

        return [
            Stat::make('Assigned Projects', $assignedProjects)
                ->color('primary'),
            Stat::make('In Progress', $activeProjects)
                ->color('warning'),
            Stat::make('Completed', $completedProjects)
                ->color('success'),
        ];
    }
}
```

Then add to Dashboard:
```php
public function getWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        \App\Filament\Expert\Widgets\ExpertStatsOverview::class,
    ];
}
```
