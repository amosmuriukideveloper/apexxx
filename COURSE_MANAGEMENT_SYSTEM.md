## Security Considerations

✅ File upload validation (type, size)
✅ User authorization (creator can only edit own courses)
✅ XSS protection (escaped content)
✅ CSRF protection (Laravel default)
⚠️ Consider video DRM for paid content
⚠️ Implement rate limiting for quiz attempts
⚠️ Add watermarks to preview videos

---

## Performance Optimization

- **Eager Loading:** Load relationships efficiently
- **Caching:** Cache course lists and analytics
- **CDN:** Serve videos from CDN
- **Lazy Loading:** Load images on demand
- **Query Optimization:** Use indexes on foreign keys

---

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the documentation
2. Review the code comments
