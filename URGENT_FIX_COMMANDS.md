Subject: URGENT - Need Composer Install to Fix Missing Dependencies

Hi Support Team,

My Laravel application is showing "Illuminate\Foundation not found" error because the /vendor directory is missing. This is normal for Laravel deployments - the vendor directory must be generated on the server using Composer.

Please run these commands in my application directory:

STEP 1: Navigate to my application directory
cd /home/[MY_USERNAME]/public_html
(or wherever my application is located)

STEP 2: Install dependencies
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev

STEP 3: Set permissions
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache

STEP 4: Run Laravel setup
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan storage:link
php artisan optimize

That's it! This will fix the missing framework files issue.

Requirements:
- PHP 8.2+ (my composer.json requires this)
- Composer installed
- MySQL database configured in .env file

Please let me know once completed so I can verify the site is working.

Thank you!
```

## üîç If They Ask for More Details

### **What is the vendor directory?**
```
The /vendor directory contains all Laravel framework files and third-party packages (over 100MB of code). It's generated by Composer from the composer.json file and is never uploaded to the server - it must be built on each environment.

Think of it like node_modules for Node.js applications.
```

### **Why wasn't it uploaded?**
```
Best practice: The vendor directory is listed in .gitignore and should never be committed to version control or uploaded. Instead, we upload composer.json and composer.lock, which tell Composer exactly what to install.

This ensures:
- Smaller uploads (50MB vs 150MB)
- Better compatibility with server environment
- Faster deployment
- Industry standard practice
```

### **What does "composer install" do?**
```
It reads composer.json and composer.lock, then downloads and installs:
- Laravel Framework (^12.0)
- Filament Admin Panel (^3.2)
- Filament Shield (security)
- Spatie Permissions
- All other dependencies

Takes 2-5 minutes, creates /vendor directory with all files.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è If You Have SSH Access Yourself

Run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Connect to your server
ssh username@your-server.com

# 2. Go to application directory
cd /home/username/public_html
# Or wherever your app is: cd ~/domains/yourdomain.com/public_html

# 3. Verify you're in the right place
ls -la
# You should see: composer.json, artisan, app/, config/, etc.

# 4. Check PHP version
php -v
# Must be 8.2 or higher

# 5. Install dependencies (THE FIX!)
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev

# This will take 2-5 minutes
# You'll see it downloading packages...

# 6. Set permissions
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
find storage -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
find bootstrap/cache -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;

# 7. Set ownership (try one of these)
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
# OR
sudo chown -R apache:apache storage bootstrap/cache
# OR
sudo chown -R nginx:nginx storage bootstrap/cache

# 8. Generate application key
php artisan key:generate

# 9. Run migrations
php artisan migrate --force

# 10. Create storage link
php artisan storage:link

# 11. Cache everything
php artisan optimize

# 12. Verify installation
php artisan --version
# Should show: Laravel Framework 12.35.1

# 13. Check if vendor exists
ls -la vendor/laravel/framework/
# Should list framework files

# 14. Test the site
curl -I https://your-domain.com
# Should return HTTP 200
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: "composer: command not found"**

**Try these paths:**
```bash
/usr/local/bin/composer --version
/usr/bin/composer --version
composer --version
php composer.phar --version
```

**If none work, install Composer:**
```bash
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

# Then use:
php composer.phar install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

### **Issue 2: "Your requirements could not be resolved"**

**Check PHP version:**
```bash
php -v
# If it shows PHP 7.x or 8.0/8.1, you need 8.2+

# Try these:
php82 -v
php8.2 -v
/usr/bin/php82 -v

# Use the correct version:
php82 /usr/local/bin/composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

### **Issue 3: "Memory limit" error**

```bash
# Increase memory for Composer
php -d memory_limit=-1 /usr/local/bin/composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

### **Issue 4: "Permission denied"**

```bash
# Fix permissions first
chmod -R 755 .
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache

# Then try again
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

### **Issue 5: Still showing errors after install**

```bash
# Clear everything and recache
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Then cache again
php artisan optimize
```
