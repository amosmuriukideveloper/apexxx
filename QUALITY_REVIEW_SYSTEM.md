   ProjectSubmission::create([
       'project_id' => $project->id,
       'expert_id' => $expert->id,

## 3. Approval Workflow

### Step-by-Step Approval Process

**When Admin Approves:**

1. **Update Submission**
   ```php
   $submission->update([
       'admin_review_status' => 'approved',
       'admin_notes' => $notes,
       'reviewed_by' => auth()->id(),
       'reviewed_at' => now(),
   ]);
   ```

2. **Update Project**
   ```php
   $project->update([
       'status' => 'completed',
       'quality_score' => $qualityScore,
       'admin_notes' => $notes,
       'completed_at' => now(),
       'payment_status' => 'confirmed',
   ]);
   ```

3. **Update Expert Statistics**
   ```php
   $expert->increment('total_projects_completed');
   $expert->increment('total_earnings', $project->expert_earnings);
   
   // Update average rating
   $newRating = (($currentRating * ($totalProjects - 1)) + $qualityScore) / $totalProjects;
   $expert->update(['rating' => round($newRating, 2)]);
   ```

4. **Send Notifications** (TODO)
   - Expert: Approval notification

## 4. Revision Request Workflow

### When Admin Requests Revision

**Process:**

1. **Validation**
   - Revision notes required
   - Must be detailed and specific

2. **Update Submission**
   ```php
   $submission->update([
       'admin_review_status' => 'revision_requested',
       'admin_notes' => $adminNotes,
       'reviewed_by' => auth()->id(),
       'reviewed_at' => now(),
   ]);
   ```

3. **Update Project**
   ```php
   $project->update([
       'status' => 'revision_required',
       'revision_notes' => $revisionRequirements,
       'admin_notes' => $adminNotes,
       'deadline' => $newDeadline ?? $project->deadline,
   ]);
   ```

4. **Send Notification to Expert** (TODO)
   ```
   Subject: Revision Required for Project #{number}
   
   Your submission requires revisions:
   {revision_notes}
   
   New deadline: {deadline}
   Please resubmit with updated reports.
   ```

5. **Version Tracking**
   - Next submission will be version N+1
   - Submission type = 'revision'
   - Previous versions remain in history

### Revision Loop

```
Expert Submits → Under Review → Revision Required
                        ↓
                  Expert Resubmits
                        ↓
                  Under Review Again
                        ↓
           Approved OR Revision Required (loop)
```

**Maximum Revisions:** No limit (admin discretion)
**Version History:** All submissions preserved

---

## 5. Rejection Workflow

### When Admin Rejects Submission

**Process:**

1. **Validation**
   - Rejection reason required
   - Must be comprehensive

2. **Update Submission**
   ```php
   $submission->update([
       'admin_review_status' => 'rejected',
       'admin_notes' => $rejectionReason,
       'reviewed_by' => auth()->id(),
       'reviewed_at' => now(),
   ]);
   ```

3. **Decision: Reassign or Cancel**

   **Option A: Reassign to Different Expert**
   ```php
   $project->update([
       'status' => 'awaiting_assignment',
       'expert_id' => null,
       'assigned_expert_id' => null,
       'admin_notes' => $rejectionReason,
   ]);
   ```
   - Project returns to assignment pool
   - New expert can be assigned
   - Original expert loses earnings
   - Student timeline extended

   **Option B: Cancel Project**
   ```php
   $project->update([
       'status' => 'cancelled',
       'admin_notes' => $rejectionReason,
   ]);
   ```
   - Project terminated
   - Refund process initiated
   - Expert does not receive payment
   - Student compensated

4. **Send Notifications** (TODO)
   - Expert: Rejection with reason
   - Student: Situation explanation
   - Admin: Refund processing

### Rejection Reasons Examples

**Poor Quality:**
```
The submission does not meet the required quality standards:
- Insufficient depth of analysis
- Multiple formatting errors
- Technical inaccuracies in sections 2 and 4
- Does not address key requirements
```

**High Plagiarism:**
```
Turnitin score of 45% is unacceptable:
- Multiple sections matched to external sources

- Proper citations missing
- Paraphrasing inadequate
```

**Excessive AI Content:**
```
AI detection shows 65% AI-generated content:
- Most sections appear to be AI-written
- Lack of critical thinking
- Generic responses without depth
- Does not meet originality requirements
```

## 8. Quality Scoring System

### Score Categories

**90-100:** Exceptional
- Far exceeds requirements
- Perfect originality
- Outstanding quality

**80-89:** Excellent
- Exceeds requirements
- Very high quality
- Minor improvements possible

**70-79:** Good
- Meets all requirements
- Quality standards met
- Professional work

**60-69:** Satisfactory
- Meets minimum requirements
- Acceptable quality
- Some areas for improvement

**Below 60:** Unsatisfactory
- Does not meet requirements
- Quality issues
- Needs significant revision

### Impact on Expert Rating

**Formula:**
```php
$newRating = (
    ($currentRating * ($totalProjectsCompleted - 1)) + $newQualityScore
) / $totalProjectsCompleted;
```

**Example:**
```
Expert has:
- Current rating: 85
- Total projects: 10

New project quality score: 92

New rating = ((85 * 9) + 92) / 10 = 85.7
```
