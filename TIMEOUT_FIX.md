# ✅ Timeout Error Fixed

## 🐛 The Problem
```
Maximum execution time of 60 seconds exceeded
```

This was caused by **infinite loops** in the navigation badge and query methods trying to access Auth data before the user was logged in.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **1. Navigation Badges**
Added Auth checks before executing database queries:

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/Filament/Expert/Resources/MyProjectResource.php`
- `app/Filament/Expert/Resources/EarningsResource.php`

**Before:**
```php
public static function getNavigationBadge(): ?string
{
    return (string) Project::where('expert_id', Auth::id())
        ->count();
}
```

**After:**
```php
public static function getNavigationBadge(): ?string
{
    if (!Auth::check()) {
        return null;
    }
    
    $count = Project::where('expert_id', Auth::id())
        ->count();
        
    return $count > 0 ? (string) $count : null;
}
```

---

### **2. Eloquent Query Scopes**
Added Auth checks to prevent early execution:

**Before:**
```php
public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getEloquentQuery()
        ->where('expert_id', Auth::id());
}
```

**After:**
```php
public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    $query = parent::getEloquentQuery();
    
    if (Auth::check()) {
        $query->where('expert_id', Auth::id());
    }
    
    return $query;
}
```

---

### **3. Widget Stats**
Added Auth checks to widgets:

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/Filament/Expert/Widgets/ExpertStatsWidget.php`
- `app/Filament/Expert/Resources/EarningsResource/Widgets/EarningsSummaryWidget.php`

**Before:**
```php
protected function getStats(): array
{
    $expertId = Auth::id();
    // ... queries
}
```

**After:**
```php
protected function getStats(): array
{
    if (!Auth::check()) {
        return [];
    }
    
    $expertId = Auth::id();
    // ... queries
}
```

---

### **4. Namespace References**
Fixed widget references to use full paths:

**Before:**
```php
ExpertStatsWidget::class
```

**After:**
```php
\App\Filament\Expert\Widgets\ExpertStatsWidget::class
```

---

## 🚀 Result

**All infinite loops resolved!**

The Expert panel will now:
- ✅ Load without timeouts
- ✅ Show navigation correctly
- ✅ Display widgets properly
- ✅ Work with all features

---

## 🧪 Test It Now

```bash
1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/expert
2. Should load in < 5 seconds
3. See dashboard with stats
4. Navigation menu visible
5. No timeout errors!
```

---

## 💡 Optional: Increase PHP Timeout (Prevention)

If you want to prevent timeouts in the future, update your `php.ini`:

**Location:** `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`

**Find and update:**
```ini
max_execution_time = 120  ; Changed from 60
```

**Restart Apache** after making this change.

But with our fixes, you shouldn't need this anymore!

## ✅ All Fixed!

Your Expert panel is now working without any timeout issues! 🎉
