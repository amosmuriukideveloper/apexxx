SUPPORT REQUEST FOR HOSTING PROVIDER
=====================================

Hi Support Team,

I'm deploying a Laravel 12 application and encountering issues with missing framework dependencies. I need your assistance with the following:

ISSUE:
------
Laravel framework files (Illuminate\Foundation components) are not loading because the /vendor directory is missing or incomplete.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The /vendor directory is generated by Composer and was not uploaded (as per Laravel best practices). It needs to be generated on the server.

WHAT I NEED:
------------

1. COMPOSER INSTALLATION
   Please confirm Composer is installed and provide the command path:
   - Is it: composer
   - Or: /usr/local/bin/composer
   - Or: php composer.phar
   - Or another path?

2. RUN COMPOSER INSTALL
   Please run this command in my application directory:
   
   Command: composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
   Directory: [INSERT YOUR FULL PATH HERE, e.g., /home/username/public_html]
   
   This will create the /vendor directory with all Laravel dependencies.

3. SET PROPER PERMISSIONS
   Please set these permissions:
   
   chmod -R 775 storage
   chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
   chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
   
   (Or use appropriate user for your server: apache, nginx, etc.)

4. VERIFY PHP VERSION
   My application requires PHP 8.2 or higher.
   Current PHP version: [Please check and confirm]
   
   If multiple PHP versions available, please use PHP 8.2+ for Composer.

5. DOCUMENT ROOT CONFIGURATION
   Please confirm the document root points to the /public directory:
   
   CORRECT: /home/username/public_html/public
   WRONG:   /home/username/public_html
   
   Laravel applications must serve from the /public directory for security.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
- Framework: Laravel 12.35.1
- PHP Required: >= 8.2
- Database: MySQL
- Dependencies: Listed in composer.json

FILES UPLOADED:
---------------
✅ Application code (app/, config/, routes/, etc.)
✅ composer.json and composer.lock (required for dependency installation)
✅ .env configuration file
✅ Public assets
❌ vendor/ directory (needs to be generated by Composer)

EXPECTED RESULT:
----------------
After running "composer install", the application should work correctly with all Laravel framework files loaded.

ADDITIONAL COMMANDS (If Needed):
---------------------------------
After Composer install succeeds, these commands may be needed:

php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan storage:link
php artisan optimize

URGENCY:
--------
This is blocking my application from going live. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help!

QUICK REFERENCE FOR SUPPORT TEAM:
==================================

The issue is standard for Laravel deployments:
1. Vendor directory is not in version control
2. It must be generated with: composer install
3. This is a 2-5 minute process that downloads ~100MB of dependencies
4. After this, the application will work normally

Similar to running "npm install" for Node.js applications.
