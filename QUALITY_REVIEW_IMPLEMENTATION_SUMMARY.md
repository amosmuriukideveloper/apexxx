## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Step Submission Wizard ✅

**4 Steps:**
- ✅ Step 1: Upload Deliverables (multiple files, 50MB max)
- ✅ Step 2: Upload Turnitin Report + Score (PDF, reactive warnings)
- ✅ Step 3: Upload AI Detection Report + Score (PDF/Image, reactive warnings)
- ✅ Step 4: Review & Confirm (summary, notes, confirmations)

**Features:**
- File type validation
- Size limits enforced
- Reactive score warnings (Turnitin > 20%, AI > 30%)
- Confirmation checkboxes required
- Version tracking (V1, V2, etc.)
- Database transactions

### 2. Admin Review Interface ✅

**Information Display:**
- Project details with status badges
- Submission version and type
- Quality scores with color coding:
  - 🟢 Green: Good (Turnitin ≤15%, AI ≤20%)
  - 🟡 Yellow: Warning (Turnitin 16-25%, AI 21-35%)
  - 🔴 Red: High (Turnitin >25%, AI >35%)
- Document links (Turnitin, AI reports, deliverables)

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Originality verified
- [ ] AI content acceptable
- [ ] Requirements met
- [ ] Formatting standards
- [ ] Technical accuracy
- [ ] Deadline compliance

**Three-Decision Workflow:**
1. **Approve** - Complete project, update stats, confirm payment
2. **Request Revision** - Send back with requirements, extend deadline
3. **Reject** - Cancel or reassign, handle refunds

### 3. Approval Workflow ✅

**Actions Performed:**
```php
✓ Update submission status → 'approved'
✓ Update project status → 'completed'
✓ Mark payment → 'confirmed'
✓ Update expert statistics:
  - Increment total_projects_completed
  - Add to total_earnings
  - Calculate new average rating
✓ Record quality score
✓ Send notifications (TODO)
✓ Transaction wrapped for data integrity
```

### 4. Revision Workflow ✅

**Actions Performed:**
```php
✓ Update submission status → 'revision_requested'
✓ Update project status → 'revision_required'
✓ Store revision requirements
✓ Optional deadline extension
✓ Version tracking (V2, V3, etc.)
✓ Send notification to expert (TODO)
✓ Loop continues until approved/rejected
```

### 5. Rejection Workflow ✅

**Two Options:**

**Option A: Reassign**
```php
✓ Project status → 'awaiting_assignment'
✓ Clear expert assignment
✓ Return to assignment pool
✓ Original expert loses earnings
✓ Notify all parties (TODO)
```

**Option B: Cancel**
```php
✓ Project status → 'cancelled'
✓ Initiate refund process
✓ Expert does not receive payment
✓ Student compensated
✓ Notify all parties (TODO)
```

### 6. Expert Statistics Updates ✅

**On Approval:**
```php
$expert->increment('total_projects_completed');
$expert->increment('total_earnings', $expertEarnings);

// Update average rating
$newRating = (($currentRating * ($totalProjects - 1)) + $qualityScore) / $totalProjects;
$expert->update(['rating' => round($newRating, 2)]);
```

### 7. Version Tracking ✅

**Submission Versioning:**
- Initial submission: V1, type='initial'
- First revision: V2, type='revision'
- Second revision: V3, type='revision'
- All versions preserved in database
- Complete history available

### 8. File Management ✅

**Storage Structure:**
```
storage/app/projects/
├── deliverables/{project_id}/
│   ├── file1.pdf
│   ├── file2.docx
│   └── code.zip
└── reports/
    ├── turnitin/{project_id}/
    │   ├── v1_turnitin.pdf
    │   └── v2_turnitin.pdf
    └── ai-detection/{project_id}/
        ├── v1_ai_report.pdf
        └── v2_ai_report.pdf
```

**Security:**
- Private storage (not publicly accessible)
- Authenticated downloads only
- File type validation
- Size limits enforced
