# ✅ Database Column Error Fixed

## 🐛 The Error

```
SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'paid_at' in 'where clause'
```

**Location:** `EarningsResource.php` navigation badge query

---

## ✅ The Fix

### **Wrong Column Name**

The code was trying to use `paid_at` which doesn't exist in the database.

**Database has:**
- ✅ `payment_status` ENUM('pending', 'paid', 'refunded')

**Code was looking for:**
- ❌ `paid_at` (doesn't exist)

---

### **What Was Changed**

**File:** `app/Filament/Expert/Resources/EarningsResource.php`

**Before (WRONG):**
```php
$pending = Project::where('expert_id', Auth::id())
    ->where('status', 'completed')
    ->whereNull('paid_at')  // ❌ Column doesn't exist
    ->count();
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```php
$pending = Project::where('expert_id', Auth::id())
    ->where('status', 'completed')
    ->where('payment_status', 'pending')  // ✅ Correct column
    ->count();
```

## 📊 Database Schema Reference

### **Projects Table Columns:**

**Payment-related columns:**
- `payment_status` - ENUM('pending', 'paid', 'refunded') - DEFAULT 'pending'
- `platform_commission` - DECIMAL(10,2)
- `expert_earnings` - DECIMAL(10,2)

**Timestamp columns:**
- `assigned_at` - When expert was assigned
- `started_at` - When expert started work
- `submitted_at` - When work was submitted
- `completed_at` - When project was completed
- `created_at` - Project creation
- `updated_at` - Last update
- `deleted_at` - Soft delete (nullable)

**Note:** There is NO `paid_at` column. Use `payment_status` instead.

---

## ✅ Result

**Navigation badge now works correctly:**
- Shows count of completed projects with `payment_status = 'pending'`
- No more database errors
- Expert panel loads successfully

---

```bash
1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/expert
2. Login
3. Should load without errors ✅
