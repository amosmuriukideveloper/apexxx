## 💰 Pricing System

### Automatic Calculation
```php
Base Price = $10/page or $0.05/word

Complexity Fee:
- Basic: 1.0x (no fee)
- Intermediate: 1.3x (+30%)
- Advanced: 1.6x (+60%)
- Expert: 2.0x (+100%)

Urgency Fee:
- ≤24hrs: 2.0x (+100%)
- ≤48hrs: 1.5x (+50%)
- ≤72hrs: 1.3x (+30%)
- Standard: 1.0x (no fee)

Total = Base + Complexity Fee + Urgency Fee

Platform Fee: 30%
Expert Earnings: 70%
```

### Example Calculation
```
10-page Advanced paper, 48hrs deadline:
Base: 10 pages × $10 = $100
Complexity: $100 × 0.6 = $60
Urgency: $100 × 0.5 = $50
Total: $100 + $60 + $50 = $210

Platform: $210 × 0.30 = $63
Expert: $210 × 0.70 = $147
```
