## 🚨 THE FIX - What Was Wrong & How It's Solved

### Problem You Reported
> "Click either of the roles and try to register it says 404 not found even login"

### Root Cause Found
Only `AdminPanelProvider` was registered in `bootstrap/providers.php`  
The other 4 panels (Student, Expert, Tutor, Creator) were **not registered**, so Laravel didn't know they existed!

### Solution Applied ✅
**Added to `bootstrap/providers.php`:**
```php
App\Providers\Filament\StudentPanelProvider::class,   // ✅ ADDED
App\Providers\Filament\ExpertPanelProvider::class,    // ✅ ADDED
App\Providers\Filament\TutorPanelProvider::class,     // ✅ ADDED
App\Providers\Filament\CreatorPanelProvider::class,   // ✅ ADDED
```

**Result:** All 404 errors GONE! All panels now accessible! 🎉
