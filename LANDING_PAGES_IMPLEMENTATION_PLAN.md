```
User clicks "View Details" on resource
    ↓
IF user is logged in
    → Show full resource detail page
ELSE
    → Redirect to login with return URL
    → After login → Redirect back to resource
```

### For Purchase

```
User clicks "Purchase" or "Enroll"
    ↓
IF user is logged in
    → Go to checkout page
ELSE
    → Show modal: "Login to Purchase"
    → After login → Go to checkout
```
